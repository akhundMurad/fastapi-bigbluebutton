## About FastAPI
> FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

My choice fell on FastAPI due to the fact that this framework is ideal for writing and 
maintaining a microservice architecture. 
Also FastAPI makes it very convenient for writing asynchronous code, 
which in turn is needed when creating a meeting on the server.

## About Bigbluebutton
> BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system.
> BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard controls), chat, and the screen. 
> Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboard, and breakout rooms.
> 
> Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.
